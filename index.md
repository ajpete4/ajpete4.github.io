### Poker as a Profession
**(January 2006 - March 2012)**

Poker was an opportunity of a lifetime to set the foundation for growth in wealth, freedom, and knowledge. This experience shaped the desire for financial freedom, travel, statigic planning, and a life of meaning.

Poker as a profession consisted of long hours of studying optimal strategies based on a certain group of players. The challenge was to pick a particular strategy(ies) based on who was at the table and how many players were in the game.

Although playing live poker in a casino was more enjoyable from a social aspect, majority of the playing time was online to take advantage of software tracking applications and the high number of hands per minute.
