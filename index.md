## Occupation

### Bluefin Data
Andrew started at Bluefin Data in the customer support role. Support of the PC-Trip Ticket program ignited conversations that uncovered the desire to build new applications for fisheries data collection. Obtaining new contracts allowed Andrew to begin the long journey of being a programmer thanks to the company support of mentors, online courses, and text books.

After evolving into a developer Andrew's next challenge was to become the CEO which later came in the fall of 2018. As CEO, Andrew leveraged his experience as a technical founder to find opportunities and grow through the complexities found in the fishing world. With a primary focus on streamlining the reporting and data collection processes across the US many new opportunities and ideas began to form. Once a firm foothold is established in the US fishing industry, Andrew sees a great amount of opportunity in international markets and expanding the company's offerings to other industries.

### Poker as a Profession
**(January 2006 - March 2012)**

Poker was an opportunity of a lifetime to set the foundation for growth in wealth, freedom, and knowledge. This experience shaped the desire for financial freedom, travel, strategic planning, and a life of meaning.

Poker as a profession consisted of long hours of studying optimal strategies based on a certain group of players. The challenge was to pick a particular strategy(ies) based on who was at the table and how many players were in the game.

Although playing live poker in a casino was more enjoyable from a social aspect, majority of the playing time was online to take advantage of software tracking applications and the high number of hands per minute.
